# Section One

An attempt to make a multi-backend metrics dashboard with a look inspired
by FiveRuns Dash.

## Current Status

**Completely doesn't work.**

This is a work in progress. The dashboard is a mockup of what I hope it to
look like and there is no logic to grab metrics from the remote services.


## Work to be done

* Dashboard builder
* Metric timeseries querier
* Composite metrics (`errors / requests * 100`)


## Initially supported backends

* [Scout](https://scoutapp.com/)
* [Librato Metrics](https://metrics.librato.com/)

## UI Mockup

So far I envision the dashboard to look something like this:
